## Embedded Software Solution for CrowdSourcing Vehicle End

- **Brief  Introduction**

  Design and solution of embedded vehicle software for crowdsourcing in Heading Data Intelligence company.

- **Design Principles**

  - Reusable
    - All sub modules code in the software platform can be reused
    - Fully decoupled
    - Self module highly independent and self applicable
  - Expandable
    - New functions have good expansibility in software platform
    - Platform is portable、tailorable and flexible in combinatn
  - High Available
    - Lightweight software platform
    - Weak external dependence
    - Less resource consumption
    - Better performance of software platform
